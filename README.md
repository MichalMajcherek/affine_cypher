# Affine Cypher

Program is made to encrypt and decrypt words using affine cypher. Program uses .json file types as an input and output. File encrypt.json has word and keys to encrypt file; file decrypt.json to decrypt. Files result_encrypt.json and result_decrypt.json are the output. Idea of the code is to have encrypt OR decrypt word as an input. If you run program multiple times you will have results in one output file, results are appended. 

Program was made in Visual Studio Code Version: 1.61.2 (Universal) on macOS Big Sur Version 11.6
